This is a Hostel Management System Project designed to simplify the process of managing students, payments, and room allocations within a hostel. The system provides full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for:
	1. Students – add, view, update, or remove student records.
	2. Payments – track payment status, amounts, and manage records efficiently.
	3. Rooms – monitor room types, capacity, and current availability status.
	
The system helps ensure room assignments are accurately tracked and automatically updates availability when students check-in or check-out. It's built with a React frontend and Node.js + MySQL backend for seamless data handling and user-friendly interaction.
